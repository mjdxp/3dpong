# 3D Pong
This is an obscure little game originally programmed by Bill Kendrick of New Breed Software developed from December 10, 1997 to April 28, 2004. While playing it, I discovered a spelling error when running it without any arguments - the `noclick1` switch is mispelled as `nockick1`. It was pretty easy to simply fix this in the original source code, so I decided I'd do so and put it here on GitHub, hopefully allowing more people to play this lovely and quite nostalgic game. If you want to play it yourself, it's fairly easy to compile it and run it on a Unix like system such as Linux or BSD. I will also put a compiled version under releases.

Please support the original developer's site here, as I did nothing but fix a small spelling error:
